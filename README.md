# ctmm-interaction
## crawl.R: the R script to run continous-time correlated random walk model
## interactionEvents_loop.R is the for-loop version script to extract all interaction events within the population
## interactionEvents_func.R is the function version script to extract all interaction events within the population. We found for-loop version runs faster than function
## overlaptime.R is the script to calculate the dynamic tracking overlap time for each interaction event
## interactionmatrix.R is the script to weight the interaction rates and summarize them for each pair
## locationerrors.R is the script to estimate locational errors of CTCWR predictions comparing to true location in simulations
