# ctmm-interaction
# crawl.R: the R script to run continous-time correlated random walk model
# interactionEvents_loop.R is the for-loop version script to extract all interaction events within the population
# interactionEvents_func.R is the function version script to extract all interaction events within the population. We found for-loop version runs faster than function
# overlaptime.R is the script to calculate the dynamic tracking overlap time for each interaction event
# interactionmatrix.R is the script to weight the interaction rates and summarize them for each pair
# locationerrors.R is the script to estimate locational errors of CTCWR predictions comparing to true location in simulations
